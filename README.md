# Flexbox_Attempt_1
 
My first attempt at using Flexbox in CSS.

My Mistakes:
- I didn't realize that background images are called up relative to the location of your CSS file. This caused the background-image property to not work properly for me, so I instead implemented a simpler solution, albeit hard-coded.
- Since I hard-coded in some parts of the website, the best way to view it is on a laptop, though I did implement a more responsive approach by using %, em, rem, and max-height.

Solutions:
- Next time, I will alter the file structure so that images can be called up properly (i.e., in relation to my stylesheet).
- I could also implement media queries (@media) to fix the breakpoints in this website, and alter styling as necessary.
- Watch a video, or learn more about how to better implement Flexbox, because in this project I implemented it using only my known knowledge for educational purposes.
